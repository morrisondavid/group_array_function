# Group Array Elements

## Setup

- `yarn`

this will install any dependencies

## Description

The function `groupArrayElements()` has been written as a node js module which could be imported into an existing codebase

Although the instructions stated that no UI is required, I have included a yarn script which will allow the function to be executed from a Node JS command line:

In order to execute the function, simply run the following commands

- `yarn groupArrayElements {inputArray} {divisor}`

- `e.g: yarn groupArrayElements [1,2,3,4,5] 3`

## Testing

Run the following in Node JS to execute the test suite:

- `yarn test`
